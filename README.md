# EV3-Maze-Solving-Robot

This project involved designing and programming an EV3 robot capable of autonomously navigating a maze designed to resemble a forest environment. The maze included tight pathways, turns, and dead ends, requiring the robot to make consistent decisions based on sensor input. Using a combination of ultrasonic and color sensors, the robot detected walls and path boundaries to determine movement and turning logic. The main challenge was creating reliable decision-making logic that allowed the robot to recover from incorrect turns without human intervention. Through iterative testing and debugging, the final program successfully guided the robot through the entire maze with consistent accuracy.

#This project was developed for Tamil 3D competition on April 2025.
